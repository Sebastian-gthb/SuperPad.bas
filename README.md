QBasic: a Arkanoid clone

It's my Arkanoid clone written in QBasic from July 1996.

The program is not finished.

You control it with the mouse. Start the ball with left click. Press ESC to exit the game.

The background image is stored in the BACKGRN.DAT file. You can use any 320x200 (64,000 byte) picture with the standard color palette. The first 7 byte in this file descibe the size to load the file with the BLOAD command.

## ToDo / Limitations
Currently we have no bricks. It's only the pad and the ball.
The angle and the speed of the ball is fixed.
